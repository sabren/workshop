= XmlSerializer =

I've begun work on a python module to convert strongbox objects to xml and back.  My inspiration for this is the ease of use with the [http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cpref/html/frlrfSystemXmlSerializationXmlSerializerClassTopic.asp .Net XmlSerializer class].

The walkthrough highlights most of the implemented features.  Test cases are also written to highlight them and make sure the module works.  Some items that still need to be worked are:

=== Validation ===
Right now, there's very little checking for valid data.  The XmlSerializer uses cStringIO, though I may switch to minidom or libxml2.  Also, there's no schema validation.  I would like to generate an Xml Schema or Relax NG, but I'm not too familiar with those yet.  What a great opportunity to learn...

=== Namespaces ===
Adding namespace support is '''very''' important.

=== DeSerializing ===
What good is this class if it can't read the data back into strongbox objects?  I don't quite know how I'm going to go about this, but this is ''definitely'' needed.
