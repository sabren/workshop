<PRE>rantelope: day 001
------------------

Today I started work on a content management system
called Rantelope. I will be posting technical discussion
of the code to the webAppWorkshop list every day this 
week, as I work on adding new features.

You can try rantelope out interactively as it 
develops; simply visit the rantelope homepage:

    <A HREF="http://www.rantelope.com/">http://www.rantelope.com/</A>

After taking a look at the live demo, you should 
follow the link to the &quot;DAY 001&quot; code, as it will
be understand the rest of this article.

==[ today's objective ]==

Today's goal was to create a VERY rough weblogging
tool. I wanted to allow multiple blogs (called 
&quot;channels&quot; in rantelope), and multiple entries
(called &quot;stories&quot;) in each channel. 

For today, the only output will be RSS. RSS is
an XML format designed for syndicating blogs and
newsfeeds.

==[ implementation ]==

If you look at the DAY 001 code, most of the logic
for the application is in the file &quot;rantelope.app&quot;
(Click the version number (1.1.1.1) to see the code)

As you can see, the code is broken into three parts:
  - the object model
  - the interface
  - the main code, which invokes the program

I will talk about each part briefly. I'm going to
be pretty technical here. If you don't understand
something, chances are taht other people have the
same question, so please ask on the webAppWorkshop
list!

Okay:

-- object model --

The object model is pretty simple. As I said, we
have Channels and Stories. One Channel can have
many Stories. Both have some attributes which
correspond to RSS tags.

The Channel class has a method to write an RSS
file. It uses a template language I wrote called
zebra. 

The &quot;rss.zb&quot; file is a fairly simple example of
a zebra template. It simply turns a a Channel
object into an RSS feed. Like python, zebra has
an indentation based syntax:

  - Lines starting with an asterisk (&quot;*&quot;) are 
    zebra statements. 
  - Items between  &quot;{:&quot; and &quot;:}&quot; are variables 
    to be insterted into the output.

Hopefully, the code in the rss.zb is self explanatory. 

-- the interface --

Getting bac to rantelope.app, we see the next part
is a big calss called &quot;RantelApp&quot;. 

Since so may web applications involve adding, editing, 
deleting, and listing things, it pays to make it simple
to do these things. Since we are using an object 
oriented language, we simply can subclass another
application and tailor it to our needs.  In this case, 
RantelApp subclasses a class called AdminApp, which 
contains genericadd/edit/delete and list routines.

RantelApp also uses zebra templates. Each call to
generic_show() includes a classname (Channel or Story)
and a zebra template filename.

So, for example, the edit_story() method near the end
of the class takes a Story and renders it using the
template in the file frm_story.zb ... The logic of 
determining WHICH Story gets loaded is handled by 
generic_show(), which RantelApp inherited from AdminApp.
Basically, AdminApp figures out what to do from the
query string. (If you're curious, try poking around
through the live demo, and watching the URL)

The other RantelApp methods are basically the same.
A couple quick notes:

   - To avoid the infamous 'user hits submit twice'
     problem, we always redirect after a form post.
     So save_channel() and save_story() both have
     a call to redirect()

   - save_story() also loads up the corresponding
     Channel object and asks it to regenerate its
     rss file. So RSS gets written whenever a story
     gets saved. (This probably ought to happen 
     in save_channel(), too)


--[ the main code ]--

When RantelApp.save_story() loads up the channel, it
gets it from self.clerk ... Every AdminApp has a clerk,
which is the object responsible for loading stuff in
and out of the storage system.

In this case, I'm using a MySQL database. The &quot;dbmap&quot;
variable explains how each object and relationship
gets mapped to my database. The database itself is
defined in the file rantelope.sql.

Notice that this is the only place a database connection
(sqlRantelope.dbc) is mentioned. If we had another kind 
of Storage class besides MySQLStorage, then the program 
would work just as well with it, and nothing would have
to be changed except the definition of CLERK.

Anyway, that's about it. All that's left is to create
a RantelApp instance, run it, and send the result to 
the browser.

--[ the end ]--

That's it. This initial version of Rantelope took about
two and a half hours to put together. And I'm sure it 
shows! If you look at it, it's not pretty AT ALL, and 
there are probably plenty of bugs. But, this is how a
web app gets its start.

Since most site authors would rather have a blog than
a raw RSS feed, the next task will be to generate HTML.
Tomorrow, I will add a simple template system that does
this, either with zebra or with the more standard XSLT.
