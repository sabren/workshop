<PRE>rantelope: day 004
---------------------------
The Ransacker Search Engine
---------------------------

Today I implemented a search engine that will eventually
tie in to Rantelope.

There's no new demo today, but links to the code are at:

    <A HREF="http://www.rantelope.com/">http://www.rantelope.com/</A>

You also can now get the code via anonymous CVS:

 cvs -d:pserver:<A HREF="mailto:anonymous@cvs.sabren.com">anonymous@cvs.sabren.com</A>:/cvs/sixthdev co MODULE

Where MODULE is python module name:
  (rantelope, ransacker, sixthday, storage, arlo, etc.)


==[ today's objective ]==

Two years ago, I wrote a search engine called ransacker, 
and set it aside to work on other things. Now that 
rantelope is here, I thought I'd hook the two together. 

But the code was awful. Ransacker was always incredibly slow,
so I did a bunch of tricks to optimize it. The result was an
unreadable mess.

So, today I rewrote it.

==[ implementation ]==

So far, the code we've been looking at is mostly simple 
scripting of existing classes and objects. Since its 
mostly front-end work, I don't worry too much about 
testing.

But today, I needed to build something useful, so I 
started by writing a test case. It looked something
like this:

###
import unittest
from ransacker import MkIndex

class MkIndexTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.idx = MkIndex()
        self.idx.add(&quot;onedog&quot;, &quot;my dog has fleas&quot;)
        self.idx.add(&quot;cathat&quot;, &quot;the cat in the hat&quot;)
        self.idx.add(&quot;twodog&quot;, &quot;it's a dog eat dog world&quot;)
    def check_match(self):
        actual = self.idx.match('dog')
        assert ('onedog' in actual) and ('twodog' in actual), \
               &quot;match() doesn't find things: %s&quot; % str(actual)
        assert actual == ('twodog', 'onedog'), \
               &quot;match() doesn't use relevance: %s&quot; % str(actual)
###      

I have a program called 'sdunit' (sixthday unit tester) that
runs tests like this for me, so all I had to do was save this
into a new file called &quot;spec/MkIndexTest.py&quot; and type &quot;sdunit&quot;.

Of course, it gave me a big nasty error message because this code
uses something called an MkIndex, and I hadn't written that yet.
But that's the point. Writing this test let me think about what
I wanted the MkIndex interface to look like, BEFORE I wrote it.

   - you add pages to the index
   - later, you can get a ranked listing back for a
     particular keyword.

So if I indexed the three strings in the setUp() method,
and then searched for &quot;dog&quot;, I should get the names of the
last and first strings. The &quot;twodog&quot; string has the word
&quot;dog&quot; twice, so it should get ranked higher.

I called it MkIndex because I knew I would be using MetaKit:

      <A HREF="http://www.equi4.com/metakit/python.html">http://www.equi4.com/metakit/python.html</A>

MetaKit is a small embedded database system. I had considered 
using it during the initial ransacker version, but never did.
I had a hunch it would be a lot faster than the disk-based
hash I used before.

Adding a page looks something like this:

   - Build a frequency chart for each word in a page, which
     is actually quite easy if you have a dictionary data type:

        def wordFreqs(text):
            fd = {}
            for word in text.split():
                if fd.has_key(word):
                    fd[word] = fd[word] + 1
                else:
                    fd[word] = 1
            return fd

   - For each unique word, add a [pagename, word, count] 
     record to the database.


So now we have an index. The match() routine just looks through
the records for all pagenames that have that word, and returns
them, sorted by the count.

Turning that into code was just a matter of keeping the 
metakit documentation handy. Pretty soon, I had it working.
It was definitely cleaner than the old code, but would it
be practical for actual use?

::<i> THE PROFILER ::
</I>
Python has a built-in profiler module. A profiler is a tool that runs
code and gives you statistics about which functions were called the
most, and how long they took. It's a great tool for finding bottlnecks
in code.

I already had a profiling script for the old ransacker, so I
figured it would make a good benchmarking tool. My test data
was a single (long) page from <A HREF="http://www.robotwisdom.com/">http://www.robotwisdom.com/</A> . 
According to the profiler, the old but optimized ransacker 
took about a second to index it.

Profiling code is easy:

   # idx = my index object
   import profile
   mycode = 'idx.add(&quot;pass1&quot;, txt)'
   profile.run(mycode)

It prints a report with the total time and the function call statistics.

Anyway, turns out new ransacker indexes the page in about 0.3 seconds.
Still slow, but the old ugly code could hardly be called &quot;optimized&quot;
anymore. :)

But there were two problems:

   1. So far, the metakit database was all in-memory, so
      we hadn't dealt with IO yet.

   2. Since each record stored the word and the name of the
      page (which would be the URL in real life), and there's
      a record for each page/word pair, the database was bound
      to get HUGE.


The first problem was easy. Just give metakit a filename. 
I did it, and the database went to disk, and it didn't 
hurt performance at all.

To solve the second problem, I took a lesson from relational 
database design, and assigned each word and page a numeric key.

So the index now looks like this: [wordID, pageID, count]

The old ransacker worked that way, too, so I based my IdMap 
class on the old object. Both simply keep a disk-based hash
that maps ID's to strings and vice versa. The code is
simple, so I won't go into it here. It's in IdMap.py
if you want to see it. Basically it works like this:

   im = IdMap()
   assert im[&quot;cat&quot;] == 1, &quot;should assign 1 to first word&quot;
   assert im[&quot;dog&quot;] == 2, &quot;should assign 2 to second word, and so on&quot;
   assert im[&quot;cat&quot;] == 1, &quot;should remember words already seen&quot;
   assert im[1] == &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;the reverse works too&quot;

To store wordID and pageID, I just asked for wordIDs[word] 
or pageIDs[page] in the appropriate places. I expected this
to add some overhead, but the speed stayed constant.

Just for fun, I tried implementing IpMap in metakit. You can
see my attempt in the &quot;AllMkIndex.py&quot; file. I abandoned it 
pretty quick though: it sent the indexing time up to 12 
seconds. It probably could be sped up by caching results,
but I didn't think it was worth pursuing.


==[ future directions ]==

The new ransacker works, but it's hardly a full-featured 
search engine. One nice thing about it is that you can 
add pages to the index incrementally - like every time
someone saves a new story. 

It doesn't let you update an old page in the index yet,
but this is extremely simple: just delete the old records
associated with that page, and add some new ones.

Also, the index itself isn't indexed. Metakit basically
looks at every record every time you search for a word.
That's part of metakit's design: rather than indexing it
just tries to be really really fast at brute force 
searching. Eventually, it might make more sense to store
the table in MySQL, and add indexes to the wordID and 
pageID columns.

Complex searches don't work. You can only search for one
word at a time. Boolean searches like &quot;cat AND dog&quot;,
&quot;cat OR dog&quot;, and &quot;cat AND NOT dog&quot; should be implemented 
by a higher level object, SearchEngine, that calls match() 
for all search terms and returns the proper subset of
results.

Finally, getting back to our content mangement system; if
rantelope is to use ransacker, there has to be a way for
rantelope to return a specific page. That means having
a unique URL for each topic. That's not implemented yet,
but it should be tomorrow, because we're going to build a
comments system. :)

---

PS: Tomorrow will be the last post out of me for about
two weeks. As much as I'd like to work interrupted on
rantelope and ransacker, I've got a hosting company 
to run... My plan is to have a 5-day period like this
one every couple weeks.

As always, comments, questions, and suggestions on the
code are welcome, and feel free to forward this to 
a friend. :)
