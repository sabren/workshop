<p><em>status 0913.2005: looks okay. weblib hasn't changed
much in years</em></p>

<p>weblib is a low level web library, that provides Request,
Response, and Session objects.</p>

<p>All the existing sixthday/platonic apps use weblib. 
however, you almost never deal with these objects 
directly anymore.</p>

<p>we should spend some time thinking about whether
weblib is even needed now that the python community has <a
href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0333.html">WSGI</a>.

= weblib overview =

=== summary ===

The weblib package provides objects for creating dynamic web
pages. These objects borrow the best ideas from technologies
such as Active Server Pages, PHPLIB, and Fusebox.

Specifically, weblib provides the following:

  * ["weblib.Request"] manages cookies, forms, query
  strings, and file uploads sent from the browser

  * ["weblib.Response"] handles response data, mime types,
  redirects, and other information coming from your script.

  * ["weblib.Sess"] uses python's serialization features to
  provide session handling that can span multiple machines.

  * ["weblib.Engine"] ties it all together and communicates
  with the web server. (There are separate Engines for
  mod_python, CGI, etc.)


=== status ===

Weblib has been fairly stable since around 1999.

=== to-do ===

The following areas need work:

  * get rid of the "config" module, which only causes trouble for new installs
  * better documentation (flesh out this paper, write a tutorial, etc)
  * refactor the various wrappers/Engines
  * create a formal release (right now code is available via CVS)
  * create a standalone weblib server (see webware project)
  * explain how Actors can be used with XML-RPC/SOAP for web services

<h2>weblib.Request</h2>

== overview ==

The request object should seem familiar to Active Server
Page developers. It provides access to information coming in
from the browser and server's environment. This object
should be considered read-only.

== methods ==

none.

== attributes ==

querystring - the actual query string used by the browser

cookie - a dictionary containing the browser's cookie variables

form - a dictionary containing the browser's form (POST) variables 

query - a dictionary containing the browser's query (GET) variables 

environ - a dictionary containing the server's environment variables



<h2>weblib.Response</h2>

== overview ==

The response object is loosely based on the Response object
provided by Microsoft's Active Server Pages. It controls a
script's output to the browser, and also provides support
for redirects, setting cookies, etc.

== methods ==

write(data) - writes data to the webout buffer (see
below). If you use the wrapper module, you can simply call
python's native print statement instead of response.write().


addHeader(key, value) - adds an HTTP header to the response.


addCookie(key, value) - adds an HTTP "Set-Cookie" header to
the response. It does not yet allow you to specify a
lifetime for the cookie.


end() - sends the buffered response to the browser, then
halts execution of the script.


redirect(url) - sends the HTTP headers needed to redirect
the browser to another url, then halts execution of the
script.

== attributes ==
none. 


<h2>weblib.Sess</h2>

== overview ==

The sess object is modeled after the Session class from the
PHP Base Libraries.

HTTP is a stateless protocol. This means the web server
forgets about the browser after every request. That's nice
for web servers, but not so nice for people writing
interactive websites. Luckily, the HTTP protocol allows
browsers at least two ways to "remind" the server that its
dealing with the same browser: cookies and the url query
string. The sess object makes use of one or both of these
methods to allow variables to persist from page to page.

For example, if a user logs in as "Fred" you can set
sess["name"]="Fred" on one page, and sess will automatically
remember Fred's name for every other page in your
application.

== methods == 

abandon() - abandons the current session url([oldurl]) -
returns oldurl (a string), but with the sessionID embedded
in it.

start([sid]) - called at start of page.. If sid is given, it
will use that session ID, otherwise, it tries to get the
session id from the response object, or, failing that,
creates a new one. Except for test purposes, sid should
probably be left blank.

freeze() - called at end of page

thaw() - this should probably be a private method..


== attributes == 

  sid - the session ID 

  mode - "cookie" or "get", usually "cookie" 

  fallbackMode - usually "get" 

  lifetime - in minutes 

  gcProb - probability of clearing out old sessions. 

  gcTime - time, in minutes, before a session is considered
  "old" and ready to be garbage collected. Note that this
  should be greater than or equal to lifetime.

== dictionary interface ==

sess is a dictionary style object, and therefore provides
has_key(), keys(), values(), and uses the standard python
syntax for dictionaries:

{{{
x = sess[key]
}}}

== notes ==

If you use the wrapper class, start() and freeze(), will be
called for you.

Data for sess is serialized via pickle and stored in a
sesspool.
