The name "sixthday" comes from the movie TheSixthDay, which
deals with cloning. In the movie, clones are created by
modifying generic, fully grown bodies stripped of genetic
information.

Similarly, the sixthday project aims to provide generic
services such as user administration, object categorization,
and form-handling. These services can be quickly strung
together and then customized through templates.

The sixthday project has been developed privately since 1998
(it was renamed after the movie) and is now available as
open source under a python style license.

There are several SixthdayApplications in various stages
of development.
