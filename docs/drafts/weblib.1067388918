=== summary ===

The weblib package provides objects for creating dynamic web pages. These objects borrow the best ideas from technologies such as Active Server Pages, PHPLIB, and Fusebox. 

Specifically, weblib provides the following:

  * ["weblib.Request"] manages cookies, forms, query strings, and file uploads sent from the browser
  * ["weblib.Response"] handles response data, mime types, redirects, and other information coming from your script.
  * ["weblib.Sess"] uses python's serialization features to provide session handling that can span multiple machines.
  * ["weblib.Engine"] ties it all together and communicates with the web server. (There are separate Engines for mod_python, CGI, etc.)


=== status ===

Weblib has been fairly stable since around 1999.

=== to-do ===

The following areas need work:

  * get rid of the "config" module, which only causes trouble for new installs
  * better documentation (flesh out this paper, write a tutorial, etc)
  * refactor the various wrappers/Engines
  * create a formal release (right now code is available via CVS)
  * create a standalone weblib server (see webware project)
  * explain how Actors can be used with XML-RPC/SOAP for web services
