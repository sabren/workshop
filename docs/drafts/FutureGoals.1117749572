  * ["arlo"]: better query support ( see rick's QueryBuilder )
  * ["storage"]: allow using keys named something other than "ID"
  * ["zebra"]: upgrade to pyXML or 4suite (vs old xmllib)
  * ["zebra"]: get old "group", "head", and "foot" tags working
  * ["sixthday"]: improve the collection of canned components/apps
  * ["ransacker"]: speed improvements, lots of refactoring
  * better docs all around
  * nightly web-based reports of unit test status, code coverage, etc


Blue sky / maybe someday:

  * a meta-app for creating object models, reports, etc
  * a GUI interface (similar to Microsoft Access) for the meta-app
  * multiple scripting languages (see http://pirate.tangentcode.com/ )
  * storage backend for with http://www.orbtech.com/wiki/PyPerSyst  
  * an actual SQL-like query language for arlo (??)
