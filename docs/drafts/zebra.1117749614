= zebra overview =

Zebra is a template language based on xml. It also provides an 
outline-based syntax that fits cleanly with python code.

At first glance, zebra may seem similar to JSP, because Zebra has tags and it compiles down to python code. However:

  * zebra is a general template system, not limited to the web
  * zebra is meant to work independently of business logic (similar to the JSP "model 2" or Model-View-Controller paradigm)

Zebra also shares some features of XSLT, and it may actually be used to transform hierarchical data. However:

   * zebra has a much more procedural / object-oriented mentality
   * zebra reports of python data structures, not pure xml
   * zebra is compiled into python code
   * zebra is scriptable through python!

=== status ===

Zebra has been stable since 2000 or so. The documentation is currently grossly out of date. (It contains tags that turned out to be redundant)

Differences from the docs :

- only python actually gets generated (no PHP, ASP, etc)

- no grouping/sorting tags.. I took them out, never put them back
  (but I miss them)

- skin/ stripe/ wrap are gone (temporarily)
- title/keywords/content/description are gone
- tail is now foot
- no direct access to database. Instead you report off "models"
  which are basically lists of dictionaries. (These are easy to
  generate from SQL queries or some XML documents, though)


- valid tags are:

        zebra - top level tag
        rem - comments
        for - loops through a list of dictionaries
        none - (part of for) shows if nothing in the list of dicts
        var - prints a variable from the current scope (skips undefined)
        xpr - evaluate and print a (python) expression (crashes if not defined)
        exec - include arbitrary python code
        if - if
        ef - else if
        el - else
        br - line break
        head - (part of for) header if the list has contents
        foot - (part of for) footer """
        include - include another zebra file

- the code is MUCH simpler - it now uses an event-driven XML
  parser to do its work.


- the docs don't match the code. :)

However, there's a whole test directory that includes example code to
test each function. This requires pyunit (from pyunit.sourceforge.net)
to run the tests. Also sdunit.

=== to-do ===

The following issues ought to be addressed:

  * Rethink the linefeed-stripping policy. (add a "squish" tag to turn it on explicitly, perhaps?)
  * update the documentation
  * allow compilation to languages other than python
  * allow compilation based on zebra templates (muahahaha)
