=== summary ===

Weblib is a library for Python programmers who want to build interactive websites. It offers objects that are similar in feel to those found in Active Server Pages and the PHP base libraries. More specifically, weblib provides the following classes:

  * ["weblib.Request"] manages cookies, forms, query strings, and file uploads sent from the browser
  * ["weblib.Response"] handles response data, mime types, redirects, and other information coming from your script.
  * ["weblib.Sess"] uses python's serialization features to provide session handling that can span multiple machines.
  * ["weblib.SessPool"] is where session data gets stored between requests.
  * ["weblib.Engine"] ties it all together and communicates with the web server. (There are separate Engines for mod_python, CGI, etc.)


=== status ===

Weblib has been fairly stable since around 1999. It has recently (2003) gone through some refactoring to make it compatible with ["twisted"]'s asynchronous programming model.

=== to-do ===

The following areas need work:

  * better documentation (flesh out this paper, write a tutorial, etc)
  * refactor the various wrappers/Engines
  * create a formal release (right now code is available via CVS)
  * finish twisted integration (perhaps also webware?)
