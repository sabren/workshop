<h1>Learn to Make Web Apps in Python!</h1>


<h2>quick overview</h2>

<p>The workshop architecture is a collection of modules that can 
be used independently.</p>

<h3>platonic components</h3>  

<p>The word platonic is used in the sense of a &quot;platonic ideal&quot;: 
platonic apps are applications decoupled from any interface whatsoever. 
This means you can <strong>reuse components in different apps</strong> - 
even web services or GUI apps.</p>

<p>platonic was actually prototyped in a perl application
done for one of those giant atlanta-based beverage companies
back in 2004. In 2005, the python libraries were extracted as I 
refactored the old sixthday stuff in the cornerhost control 
panel (&quot;cornerops&quot;) using the ideas from the perl project...</p>

<p>Therefore, cornerops is currently the only platonic web
app written in python. Most of the paid work in this
framework would be for cornerops / versionops (for
versionhost) and duckbill (a billing system).  However,
these are all fairly huge projects and not open source (at
least for now)...</p>

<p>So, in order to let people play around with the code, we
need an open source app. There are several planned, but all
of them will be based on a simple application called amoeba.</p>


<h2>amoeba and trailblazer</h2>

<p>The flagship program for this architecture is called
amoeba. It is sort of a cross between a wiki and a
relational database, and is based around an <a
href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2001/01/24/rdf.html">RDF
model</a>.</p>

<p>Basically amoeba is what ties platonic to the web.  It's
both a generic (but useful!) web app and a <a
href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/top.htm">RESTful</a>
web service.</p>

<p>
Amoeba is the proto-app: when you go to make a platonic web
app, you should instantiate an amoeba, which you can then
extend with your own features through the miracle of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition">object
composition</a>. :)</p>

<p>You can watch an <a
href="http://platonicamoeba.com/demo/200407/">early video
demo</a> of amoeba (macromedia flash with sound) if you
want to see what amoeba looks like.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, amoeba was written as a sixthday app (no
unit tests) but will soon be rewritten as a platonic web
app using a narrative programming tool called trailblazer.</p>

<p>What trailblazer does is allow you to see the program
being built as you read, so that you aren't overwhelmed 
with trying to understand a complete design, but rather
can see it evolve step by step.</p>

<p>The earlier tutorials below also use a narrative style,
but were written before trailblazer, and so aren't actual
running programs.</p>

<h2>browse the code</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://webappworkshop.com/pydoc/">pydoc
pages</a> were generated 0913.2005 from the latest version
of the modules</p> 


<p>cvs browser is <a href="https://sixthdev.versionhost.com/viewcvs.cgi/">here</a>.
a lot of that stuff isn't web-related, though, so here's the short list:</p>

<h2>basic lessons</h2>

<p><strong>Sep 13, 2005:</strong> these lessons were written
in May of 2002. Except for the last one, these describe very 
basic stuff that hasn't changed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="old/000000.html">&quot;Hello, %s!&quot;</a> - simple weblib usage</li>
<li><a href="old/000001.html">The Spec</a> - cornerhost control panel overview </li>
<li><a href="old/000002.html">Data objects</a> - basic python class usage</li>
<li><a href="old/000003.html">Strongbox</a> - more on the control panel,
     plus  how we really do data objects</li>
<li><a href="old/000004.html">App and WikiApp</a> <em>(old school)</em>
  this talks about an older web framework called <code>sixthday</code>, which has 
  been discarded in favor of the more flexible and testable 
  <code>platonic</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>project: rantelope</h2>

<p><strong>Sep 13, 2005:</strong> rantelope is a content
management system. In the simplest case, it works as a
blogging tool like movable type or wordpress. These lessons
were written in September 2002 in a one week sprint when the
blogging features were created, and describe the old
sixthday approach. As such, they are out of date and need to
be reworked.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="old/000005.html">Channels, Stories, and Raw RSS</a></li>
<li><a href="old/000006.html">RSS-to-HTML with XSLT Templates</a></li>
<li><a href="old/000007.html">Yahoo!-style Hierarchies</a></li>
<li><a href="old/000008.html">The Ransacker Search Engine</a></li>
<li><a href="old/000009.html">Comment system and next steps</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>other docs</h2>

<p>These were pages from an old wiki that used to be here.
They're <em>mostly</em> up to date as of september 2005</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="old/FiveMinutePython.html">basic intro to python</a></li>
<li><a href="old/CodingStandards.html">coding standards</a></li>
<li><a href="old/SettingUpShop.html">setting things up for using the framework</a></li>
<li><a href="old/strongbox.html">strongbox documentation</a></li>
<li><a href="old/storage-where.html">where-clauses in storage/arlo</a></li>
<li><a href="old/weblib.html">weblib - low level request/response/session library</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>historical</h2>

<ul>
<li><a href="old/sixthday.html">sixthday</a> was how apps were
structured before <code>platonic</code>. Sixthday was fun but
it was hard to write tests for sixthday apps. Platonic solved
the testing problem, so sixthday went out the door. However,
many of the notes in this document still apply to platonic.</li>

<li><a href="old/strongbox-idea.html">strongbox idea</a> -
this was an early attempt to gather my ideas for what would
become strongbox</li>

<li><a href="old/zdc.html">zdc</a> was an early data object
concept. the downside was that each instance  was tied to a
database, so you couldn't even run the tests without connecting
to MySQL. zdc was replaced by <code>strongbox</code>, 
<code>arlo</code>, and <code>storage</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>the app list</h2>

<p>Several apps have been written with this framework:</p>

<p>These three are the most advanced, and in constant use:</p>

<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://cornerhost.com/">cornerhost</a> control panel</li>
<li>the <a href="http://versionhost.com/">versionhost</a> control panel</li>
<li><a href="old/duckbill.html">duckbill</a>, the billing system used at cornerhost/versionhost</li>
</ul>

<p>These haven't been worked out completely</p>

<ul>
<li>amoeba - sort of like a wiki crossed with a database</li>
<li><a href="http://rantelope.com/">rantelope</a> 
    - the content management system mentioned above</li>
<li>planaconda - a project management tool</li>
<li>buggernaut - a bug tracking system</li>
<li>solomon - a knowledge base / customer support system</li>
<li>zikeshop - this was a shopping cart system. <em>currently suffering bit rot</em> </li>
<li><a href="http://linkwatcher.com/">linkwatcher</a> - a website 
    that monitors other sites for changes
    (some of this is still old php stuff)</li>
<li><a href="http://letsbank.org/">letsbank</a> - 
    an alternative currency banking system for communities</li>
</ul>
