NOTE: 10/23/2003 - this wiki is the old sixthdev.com site. We're still blowing out the cobwebs here, so some of the technical details are very much out of date. However the descriptions of what things ARE is valid. You can see current pydoc generated documentation here:

The webapp framework is an architecture for rapidly creating
interactive, object-oriented web applications. It uses the 
PythonProgrammingLanguage and consists of the following
modules:

  * ["weblib"] - web classes similar to those in ASP and PHPLIB.
  * ["arlo"] - object-relational mapping
  * ["storage"] - a generic interface to various storage systems
  * ["strongbox"] - observable data objects with runtime type checking
  * ["zebra"] - template language that compiles to python code.
  * ["sixthday"] - generic web applications and helper classes. (will probably be renamed soon)

As well as the following support modules:

  * ["sdunit"] - pyunit extensions to help with TestDrivenDevelopment
  * ["pytypes"] - various useful python classes and types
  * ["handy"] - small useful routines functions
  * ["ransacker"] - scriptable, incrementally-double-indexed search engine.
  * ["payment"] - integration with merchant accounts for online credit card processing.
