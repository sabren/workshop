The more I think about it, the more I realize I'm just sick of dealing with linkwatcher. I don't even use it myself anymore, and there are much better tools out there for doing what it does. So I'm taking it down for a while: http://www.linkwatcher.com/hiatus.html

I didn't get much done this weekend after all. I'll bring linkwatcher back up to normal tomorrow (monday), but no new features this time around.

== 0222.2002 ==

It's that time again. I'm moving linkwatcher to a new server,
and adding some new features. This will most likely take
all weekend.

'''4:15pm''' - Did some major refactoring on diffbot, added in the
new diff-related, code, and it seems to be working. I'm not 100% sure
it's filtering out ALL the fake updates... I'm going to run it for 
a few days and see what it lets through. 

I'm done for the day. Next linkwatcher development session will 
be some day next week. I want to clean out the database and maybe
implement favorites...

'''12:47pm''' - I set up a new CVS repository, and have been working on diffbot. Turns out most of what I want to do with handling changes can be picked up from the following command:

{{{
diff -u beforefile afterfile | grep @@
}}}

This strips out the actual content and leaves the header showing where the lines were changed. Some examples:

{{{

# at the top and removed at the bottom

'''12:00pm''' - It's amazing what kind of mess you can create through three years (three??) of hacks and quick fixes. I'm tempted to throw everything out and just start over, but I know from experience what a horrible mistake THAT is... I ''am'' going to start a new, clean, CVS repository though, and slowly mix in refactored versions of the old junk.

'''11:23am''' - CVS was way out of date (so's the FAQ). Not sure how that happened. Probably something in the move. I'm cleaning it up now.

'''11:12am''' - Just turned off the current site. Everything's a mess in there, and I need to do some cleanups. (Plus I can't have the bot running around while I'm working.)
