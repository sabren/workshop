<title>nodak: modelling unstructured data with triples</title>

<goal>one table for all your data</goal>

<p>could we create a generic schema? yes. the
trick is to break the table apart:</p>

<pre>
      <strong>c1</strong>   c2   c3
------------------
<strong>r1</strong> | <strong>v11</strong>  v12  v13
r2 | v21  v22  v23
</pre>

<p>becomes:</p>

<pre>
subject  predicate   object
---------------------------
<strong>r1       c1          v11</strong>
r1       c2          v12
r1       c3          v13
r2       c1          v21
r2       c2          v22
r2       c3          v23
</pre>



<todo>
[00:16] michal: rantelope/amoeba is only going to have three tables...
[00:16] michal: with three tables, we can track stories, comments, users, categories, versions... everything...

table resource: id url
table relation: id sub rel obj began ended
table property: id sub rel val began ended



[00:17] michal: it's so simple. that's why wordpress pisses me off. too much work to implement something simple like multiple blogs in one installation
[00:18] michal: i know that's completely off topic but i was going back to why wordpress sucks
[00:18] joethepeacock: wow.
[00:18] joethepeacock: that's remarkably simple
[00:19] joethepeacock: how's that possible???
...
[00:21] michal: it's just a list of assignments basically
[00:21] michal: yeah kind of
[00:21] michal: the whole rdf/semantic web thing boils down to 'subject  relationship object'
[00:22] michal: and if you normalize a table like that you get the three tables i mentioned
[00:22] michal: oh plus i added 'began' and 'ended' for versioning
[00:22] michal: resouce is a url
[00:22] michal: so you can add data to your own records or to records/pages anywhere on the net
[00:24] joethepeacock: wow
[00:24] joethepeacock: that's pretty wierd.
[00:24] joethepeacock: how'd you come up with this?
[00:24] michal: i guess really you don't need the property table either...
[00:24] michal: i didn't.. it's rdf
[00:24] michal: i just read the semantic web junk
[00:25] michal: i had the basic idea back in 2003:   http://www.cornerhost.com/archives/rantelope-devel/2003-June/000000.html
[00:25] michal: but once i started i saw it was looking more and more like rdf
[00:26] michal: so i just adopted their stuff
[00:26] michal: actually that word 'relation' is actually the basis for relational databases...
[00:26] michal: the tables and joins and all that are actually derived from this simpler model
[00:27] michal: at least they can be..
[00:27] michal: anyway the idea is you can add all kinds of freeform extensions without actually mucking about with a database
[00:27] michal: and only add real tables if you need to optimize
[00:29] michal: huh. okay. sorry for rambling. i needed to explain that to someone for the trailblazer file :)
[00:29] joethepeacock: hahaha

<p>Yeah, okay, except there's a problem. We don't
really want to split statements into two tables.
That means we have to do twice as many queries,
and that's just dumb. So we'll stick to two tables.
Nodes and Arcs. And the arc table can just have
two columns. If we're dealing with a literal, then
we'll just make the objectID 0.</p>


<goal>two tables if you normalize</goal>

<todo>generate the sql with a schema </todo>

    cur.execute(
        """
