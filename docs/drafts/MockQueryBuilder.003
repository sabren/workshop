= MockQueryBuilder =

== New ==
I've modified my MockQueryBuilder to support & and | expressions.  

So, to match all users with an age between 21 and 25 or a name starting with 'b', ordered by the name property  (descending), you would use:
{{{
clerk.match(User,
  ((clerk.User.age>21) & (clerk.User.age<25))
  | (clerk.User.name.startswith('b')), 'name desc')
}}}

== Summary ==

This is my attempt at building a QueryBuilder that will work against a non-SQL database.  The ["storage"] module comes with the MockStorage implementation, providing a basic dictionary database.  It is used only in testing.

[http://techno-weenie.com.mn.sabren.com/ex/MockStorage.py.txt Download MockStorage.py]
[http://techno-weenie.com.mn.sabren.com/ex/MockStorageTest.py.txt Download MockStorageTest.py]

This isn't exactly meant for real use.  But, the storage unittests all derive from the MockStorageTest, so an implementation of the QueryBuilder was needed.

== Matching Rows ==

I had to change the method signature for one method, ''match'':
{{{
MockStorage.match(table, **where)
}}}
becomes
{{{
MockStorage.match(table, where=None)
}}}
First, leaving out the where parameter will select all rows, just like in the original implementation.  But, the syntax for matching against multiple rows has changed.

To select something the old way, you used:
{{{
>>> store = MockStorage()
# populate database
>>> rows = store.match("tablename", name="Fred")
}}}

Now, with the QueryBuilder:
(''MockStorage.q'' is an empty instance of the QueryBuilder)
{{{
>>> store = MockStorage()
# populate database
>>> rows = store.match("tablename", store.q.tablename.name == "Fred")
}}}

== Deleting Rows ==
Deleting rows has been enhanced.  It still takes the old method:
{{{
>>> store.delete("tablename", 1)
}}}
This basically maps to:
{{{
>>> store.delete("tablename", store.q.tablename.ID==1)
}}}

But, you can now do something like:

{{{
>>> store.delete("users", store.q.users.groupID==5)
}}}

== How It's Done ==
'''UPDATED'''
Instead of returning a(n) SQL WHERE statement, it returns a MockExpression object.  This object has a property Pattern which is simply a tuple with three values: the original value, the value to match agains, and the operation to match with.

The MockQueryBuilder does not support AND or OR expressions, only the MockExpression does.  When you do an AND or OR comparison of two MockExpression objects, it returns a MockComplexExpression.  A MockComplexExpression holds a reference of both MockExpressions in a Left and Right property, as well as the operation to compare with (AND or OR).

Here's what the _dictmatch() method looks like:
{{{
def _dictmatch(self, expression, subject):
    if isinstance(expression, MockComplexExpression):
        return getattr(self._dictmatch(expression.left, subject), expression.operation)(self._dictmatch(expression.right, subject))
    else:
        (prop, val, op) = expression.pattern
        # get the property value to check
        # take the value after the right-most period
        if '.' in prop: prop = prop[prop.rindex('.')+1:]
        p = subject[prop]
        # perform the operation from the pattern against the value
        try:
            res = getattr(str(p).lower(), op)(str(val).lower())
            # str.index returns 0 if a match is found in the first character, so return 1
            if op == 'index': return 1
            return res
        except ValueError:
            # str.index raises ValueError if no match is found, return 0
            return 0

}}}

Let's break it apart:

{{{
# simplified for readability
if isinstance(expression, MockComplexExpression):
    leftValue = self._dictmatch(expression.left, subject)
    op = expression.operation # should be '__and__' or '__or__'
    rightValue = self._dictmatch(expression.right, subject)

    return getattr(leftValue, op, rightValue)
}}}

This basically checks to see if the expression is a MockComplexExpression.  If it is, then it compares the results of _dictmatch() for both the left and right MockExpression objects.

{{{
(prop, val, op) = expression.pattern
# get the property value to check
# take the value after the right-most period
if '.' in prop: prop = prop[prop.rindex('.')+1:]
p = subject[prop]
# perform the operation from the pattern against the value
try:
	res = getattr(str(p).lower(), op)(str(val).lower())
	# str.index returns 0 if a match is found in the first character, so return 1
	if op == 'index': return 1
	return res
except ValueError:
	# str.index raises ValueError if no match is found, return 0
	return 0
}}}

If _dictmatch() does not get a MockComplexExpression, it should be a MockExpression.  So, get the property, value, and operation values from the MockExpression.pattern tuple.  

{{{
if '.' in prop: prop = prop[prop.rindex('.')+1:]
p = subject[prop]
}}}
It needs to get the value to match from the row (subject).  If there's a '.' in the name (such as 'table.field'), then we only want the field name.

{{{
res = getattr(str(p).lower(), op)(str(val).lower())
}}}
Now, we get a reference to the operation (''str.__eq__'' for equality, ''str.__ne__'' for not equal, ''str.startswith'', etc).  Then, we compare it to the value and get a result back.

All the comparison methods return 1 for true and 0 for false, except for ''str.index'' (which is called for ''QueryBuilder.contains()'').  If anything is returned, that means there's a match so it returns one.  However, if no match is found, a ''ValueError'' is raised, and 0 is returned.

== Problems ==

  * ''store.q.tablename.fieldname'' seems like a lot of typing, when all you needed before was just ''fieldname''

Comments and/or ideas are welcome.
