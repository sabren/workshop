'''Some notes I wrote a while back:'''

It's okay to reinvent the wheel.

It's even better to copy other people's wheels and paint them to our liking. 

The vision here is a set of libraries and applications that have a unified feel to them. These are separate apps with a shared culture, not one gigantic app that does everything or herds of completely incompatible utilities.

Why shoot for this? Because we want to make it easy to share knowledge between ourselves. If my bug tracking system works more or less like your blog editor, then we can share bits and pieces. Face it, every python web app out there has its own layers for storage, template, web, authentication, you name it. Merging all those codebases would be a nightmare, but if someone takes it upon themselves to steal the best ideas from each one, then that project will probably be in good shape. That's what I want to do here. 

Ideally, people will work together one on one. I see myself writing lots of documentation here, and I see a lot of PairProgramming going on rather than people just submitting patches. If someone just sends me a patch I have to figure out what the heck it's all about. If they work with me to build it, then I'll understand... I don't personally have to be one of the people pairing, I just think that two people produce better code than one, and that it's a good way to build software.
