''Introducing links and linksets''

== Intro ==
We have a simple user class, but it's not very interesting.  So, I'm going to create a couple other classes and link them to the user class.

=== Links ===
First thing, I'm going to create a simple Group class to assign users in:
{{{
class Group(Strongbox):
    ID = attr(long, default=None)
    name = attr(str)
}}}

Extemely simple.  I will have to add a property to the User control from the previous entry:
{{{
class User(Strongbox):
    ID = attr(long, default=None)
    name = attr(str)
    passwd = attr(str)
    email = attr(str)
    group = link(Group)
}}}

Notice that the group property is using the LinkInjector() class instead of the Attribute() class.  This says that the group property contains a Group object.

Now, let's use the classes:
{{{
>>> g = Group(name='Admins')
>>> u = User(name='rick', password='test', email='rick@server.com', group=g)
>>> u.group.name
'Admins'
}}}

=== Linksets ===
