== overview ==

Strongbox is a python module that lets you define data objects that are rigorous about what attributes they have, and what values these attributes let in. 

Each attribute holds one type of value. Types are very flexible. They can be:
   * simple scalar types (str, int, float)
   * custom scalar types (FixedPoint, EmailAddress, etc)
   * anonymous types specified with regular expressions or lambdas
   * another strongbox class (via link attributes)
   * a list of a strongbox instances (via linkset attributes)
   * any other type (dict, list, class, function...) -- but these are kinda bad form

The attributes you defined are implemented using python 2.x's properties and __slots__ features, so they are the only attributes allowed on your object. But if you need to store arbitrary data internally, that's fine - all instances have a member called "private", which is just a plain old python object that you can do whatever you like with.

You don't usually need to create getter and setter methods, but you can if you want. Any method named get_XXX or set_XXX automatically behaves as an accessor for the XXX attribute. You can even define "virtual" attributes this way.

One of the main goals for strongbox is to provide classes that can be easily mapped to and from a relational database. However, Strongboxes are storage-agnostic and do not require any database to work. Strongboxes implement the observer pattern, so they can notify observers when they change; and also a variant called the "injector" pattern, so they can trigger external lazy-loading schemes (such as arlo) whenever external data is needed. 


== usage ==

When you define a strongbox class, you define a set of Attributes:

{{{
>>> from strongbox import *
>>> class Person(Strongbox):
...     name = attr(str)
...     age = attr(int, default=20, okay=lambda n: 0 < n < 150)
...     def get_canDrink(self):
...         return self.age >= 21
}}}

Attributes can be passed in on the constructor:

{{{
>>> fred = Person(name="fred")
>>> fred.name
'fred'
}}}

Attributes can have validation rules and default values:

{{{
>>> fred.age # note the default, above
20
>>> fred.canDrink
0
>>> fred.age = 50
>>> fred.canDrink
1
>>> fred.age = 500
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
  File "/home/sabren/lib/strongbox/BoxMaker.py", line 81, in setter
    val = getattr(klass, slot).sanitize(val)
  File "/home/sabren/lib/strongbox/Attribute.py", line 83, in sanitize
    raise ValueError, repr(value) + " vs " + repr(self.okay)
ValueError: 500 vs <function <lambda> at 0x81afacc>
>>>
}}}

== similar projects ==

Guido's explains metaclasses here:

  http://www.python.org/2.2/descrintro.html#metaclasses

SqlObject is similar to strongbox + arlo, but (as far as I can tell) is tightly coupled to a database:

  http://sqlobject.org/

BasicProperty (and BasicTypes) for Python looks very similar, both in spirit and implementation. This appears to be a fairly new project, and I have not really looked into it:

  http://basicproperty.sourceforge.net/

WebWare's MiddleKit is also related:
