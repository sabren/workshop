<title>general approach to database apps</title>


<p>This is just a general approach that we'll use over
and over again. It makes for good testing, so it's a good
trail to follow.</p>

<goal>Define the Shape of the Data</goal>


<goal>Show an Empty Record List</goal>

<p>When you first start there should be no records,
so this is actually a good test case.</p>


<goal>Create a Form for Addding Records</goal>

<p>Next up, create the form to add some data.as you work on this </p>



<goal>Save the Form Data</goal>



<goal>Show Populated Record List</goal>



<goal>Show/Edit a Record</goal>


<goal>Delete a Record</goal>
