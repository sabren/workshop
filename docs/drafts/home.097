= sixthdev: sixthday development wiki =

Sixthday is an architecture for rapidly creating
interactive, object-oriented web applications. It uses the
PythonProgrammingLanguage and consists of the following
modules:

  * ["weblib"] - web classes similar to those in ASP and PHPLIB.
  * ["zdc"] - flexible object-relational mapping.
  * ["zebra"] - template language that compiles to python code.
  * ["sdunit"] - pyUnit extensions for sixthday development.
  * ["sixthday"] - generic web applications and helper classes.

As well as the following support modules:

  * ["payment"] - integration with merchant accounts for online credit card processing.
  * ["ransacker"] - scriptable, incrementally-double-indexed search engine.

Here are some starting points:

   * AboutSixthday - who, what, when, where, why...
   * CodingStandards
   * SixthdayApplications - existing projects
   * LinkwatcherRevival - a site redesign using sixthday.
   * NewbieQuestions - feel free to post yours!
   * The MemberPage directory - contributors to the project
   * SimilarProjects we can steal... uh.. learn from :)

This site is a WikiWikiWeb, or "wiki" for short. (Actually, 
it's MoinMoin, a python wiki) That means you can edit the pages yourself as you see fit. ''Please be respectful!'' And remember to SignYourName!

Feel free to look around ask questions, and create your own
MemberPage.

Have fun!
