= sdunit white paper =

sdunit is the xUnit testing tool for sixthday. It's really just the standard pyUnit, plus a set of (questionable?) standards for testing.

It's text-based, and when you run it, it looks something like this:

{{{
W:\zdc>sdunit
** testing ObjectView:
** testing Table: ....
** testing Date: .....
** testing LinkSet: ..
** testing Connection: .
** testing Record: ........
** testing Functions: ...
** testing RecordObject: .....
** testing Object: ......
** testing Junction: .
** testing DBAPI2Driver: .
** testing IdxDict: ......
}}}

  * Re-think the standards. Setting up test cases for these projects currently requires too much work. :)
