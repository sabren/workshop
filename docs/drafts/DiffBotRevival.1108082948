The diffbot is the program that maintains the linkwatcher database.
It's job is to:

   * visit pages that haven't been checked in a while
   * run diff and see if they've been updated
   * add changed pages to the search engine

A more detailed spec is on DiffBotSpec.

Going up a level, it's likely that at least some (perhaps many/most)
of the people maintaining the pages the diffbot watches would be
willing to 'ping' linkwatcher when they update, and avoid polling
entirely (at least some of them already have an automatic process
that pings weblogs.com, for instance, and adding linkwatcher might
be trivial).  So for those sites the diffbot wouldn't have to
poll at all, helping with scaling issues. 

I definately think the "ping" method a la weblogs.com is the way to go. It eliminates at least half of the work load for the linkwatcher. All you'll have to worry about is presentation.
