<h2>Hello, World!</h2>

<p>
The traditonal introduction to a computer language is the
&quot;Hello, World!&quot; program. In python, it's a
one-liner:</p>


<pre>
print &quot;hello, world!&quot;
</pre>

<p>Easy, huh? If you load up a python interpreter and type
that line, it'll print &quot;hello, world!&quot; to the
screen.</p>

<h2>The Response Object</h2>

<p>
Web apps don't print their output to a screen, but send it
across the internet. For this reason (and others I'll go
into later on), we redirect the output to a response
object. In the framework that I use, this object is called
RES:</p>


<pre>
print &gt;&gt; RES, &quot;hello, world!&quot;
</pre>


<p>That's it! Our first web application!</p>


<p>So how can we see it work?</p>


<p>To run this on a cornerhost server, put it in a text file
with the extension &quot;.app&quot;. Call this one
<code>hello.app</code> and upload it to your account.</p>

<p>
Now load it in your browser as if it were a normal web page.
If all goes well, you should see:
</p>

<pre>
   hello, world!
</pre>

<p>
If you get an error message, double check that you have the
filename correct and that the file contains no leading tabs
or spaces - python has very strict rules about whitespace.
</p>

<h2>Hello, NAME!</h2>

<p>
Let's personalize our greeting a bit. Python lets us insert
a variable (a defined value) into our output by using the
percent sign:</p>

<pre>
name = &quot;Orville&quot;
print &gt;&gt; RES, &quot;hello, %s!&quot; % name
</pre>

<p>
If you upload this script and load it in the browser, the
result should be:</p>

<pre>
   hello, Orville!
</pre>

<h2>The Request Object</h2>

<p>
Of course, most of the people using your app won't be named
Orville. One way of passing a name into our app would be to
include it in the query string:
</p>


<pre>
   http:// ... /hello.app?name=Gomer
</pre>


<p>
We can read the query string with the REQ (Request) object:
</p>

<pre>
    name = REQ.get(&quot;name&quot;)
</pre>

<p>Better yet, we can provide a default:</p>

<pre>
  name = REQ.get(&quot;name&quot;, &quot;whoever you are&quot;)
  print &gt;&gt; RES, &quot;hello, %s!&quot; % name
</pre>

<p>Try running this with and without a
&quot;?name=whatever&quot; appended to the url.</p>


<h2>Adding a Form</h2>

<p>
But why settle for a default, when we can simply ask users
what their names are? This next example uses the
REQ.has_key() method to tell if a name has been passed
in. If so, it says hello. If not, it shows an HTML form:
</p>

<pre>
if REQ.has_key(&quot;name&quot;):
    print &gt;&gt; RES, &quot;hello, %s!&quot; % REQ.get(&quot;name&quot;)
else:
    # notice the single quotes, to prevent conflict with HTML:
    print &gt;&gt; RES, '&lt;form action=&quot;hello.app&quot; method=&quot;GET&quot;&gt;'
    print &gt;&gt; RES, 'What is your name?'
    print &gt;&gt; RES, '&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; value=&quot;&quot;&gt;'
    print &gt;&gt; RES, '&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;'
    print &gt;&gt; RES, '&lt;/form&gt;'
</pre>


<h2>Yuck!</h2>

<p>
There's nothing wrong with that code, but it sure isn't
pretty.  If you wanted to make the form look nicer, you'd
have to add a whole lot more of those &quot;print &gt;&gt;
RES&quot; lines, and that would get old real fast.  Worse,
it's hard to read and hard to maintain.
</p>


<p>
In the next lesson, we'll look at a way of solving these
problems by separating the logic of an app from its
presentation.
