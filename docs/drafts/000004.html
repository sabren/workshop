<h1>App and WikiApp</h1>

(<em>0913.2005: huh. I thought that was a Nietzsche
reference, but it's actually a <a
href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/3328">George Bernard
Shaw reference</a>.  (But it's all good, because Shaw was
referencing Nietzche :)</em>)

* Hello Again!

Our old hello.app file looked like this:

###
print &gt;&gt; RES, &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
###


Nice and simple. But here's how I'd *REALLY* write it:


###
&quot;&quot;&quot;
HelloApp: a &quot;hello world&quot; webApp
&quot;&quot;&quot;
from sixthday import App

class HelloApp(App):
    def act_(self):
        self.write(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

if __name__==&quot;__main__&quot;:
    print &gt;&gt; RES, HelloApp(REQ).act()
###



* What Does all That Mean?

Very quickly, here's what that code says in English:

   We want to work with App objects, which are defined 
   in a python package called sixthday.

   A HelloApp is just like an App, except:
       when a HelloApp is asked to &quot;act_&quot;,
           it says &quot;Hello, world!&quot;

   If someone's trying to actually run this file
   (rather than reuse our definitions somewhere else):

       Make a new HelloApp, passing it the REQuest object
       for input, and tell the HelloApp to &quot;act&quot;. 
       Send whatever it says out to the RESponse object.



* WikiApp: A Little More Challenging

We've grown from one line of code to six and a comment. What
did it buy us? 

If all we want our program to do is say hello, we've gained
nothing. But most programs are more complex. For example,
let's consider a simple wiki.

A wiki is a website that anybody can edit. It's not easy
to explain if you've never used one, so if you haven't,
follow this link to the original wiki:

      <A HREF="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WelcomeVisitors</A>

      (And by the way: that particular wiki is FULL of great writing
      about object-oriented programming and the &quot;eXtreme Programming&quot;
      practices. It's definitely worth wandering around in!)

A wiki has several required features:

     - show a page, given a WikiPageNameLikeThis
     - provide a form where anyone can edit a page
     - save the page once its been edited
     - WikiPageNames automatically turn into hyperlinks

There's a bigger list at: <A HREF="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiPrinciples">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiPrinciples</A> 
but I wanted to keep this simple.

If you notice, the first three features each occur in a separate HTTP
request: Click a link to bring up a page, click a link to bring up the
form, click a submit button to post and save.



* Apps are Objects!

The logic behind those three actions is simple. But how should we
organize it? Do we make three separate scripts? One script with 
a bunch of if-then statements?

Both approaches are common. The first few times I built an an app in
VBScript (ASP), I went for the &quot;one big file&quot; approach. I found this
made ASP files hard to debug. Later I experimented with separate files
for each feature; big files full of common functions; separate files
for logic and HTML; and a ColdFusion approach called FuseBox where the
whole app is one big switch statement, with each feature defined
outside the main file.

My point is: organizing code becomes a real problem as projects get
bigger, and there are lots of opinions out there about what works
best. App is mine.

The magic of App is that each App can handle multiple functions, and
those functions can be accessed dynamically, based on an &quot;action&quot;
parameter in the query string or form post.

In other words, WikiApp's structure might look like this:

###
class WikiApp(App):
    def act_show(self): pass
    def act_edit(self): pass
    def act_save(self): pass
print &gt;&gt; RES, WikiApp(REQ).act()
###

When the &quot;act()&quot; message is sent on the last line,
the WikiApp figures out which method to call based
on an &quot;action&quot; parameter.

For example, browsing to <A HREF="http://.../wiki.app?action=show">http://.../wiki.app?action=show</A>
would run the act_show() method.

If no ?action=XXX is given, Apps call a default method 
named &quot;act_()&quot;, which we saw earlier in the HelloApp. In
a wiki, our default action might be to show the front page:

###
    def act_(self):
        self.input[&quot;page&quot;]=&quot;FrontPage&quot;
        self.act_show()
###

What is self.input? Well, in this case, it's just the REQ object.
But we call it &quot;self.input&quot; inside the App because Apps don't
necessarily have to be run through the web.


* Apps Get Around

That bears repeating: App objects do not necesarily have to run
through the web. Where else might they run? Perhaps in a GUI app, or
from the command line, from inside another App, or from an automated
test case.[1]

Because Apps are objects, they can be used just about anywhere.  They
can also be subclassed: you can create a BetterWikiApp that is just
like WikiApp except for one little part, and you don't even have to
cut and paste:

###
class BetterWikiApp(WikiApp):
   ...
###


* Check it Out:

Anyway, with those concepts out of the way, the rest of the 
wikiApp code is pretty straightforward. Take a look at the
code and see if you can figure out how it works:

And you can download it here:

Feel free to post any questions you have to the workshop list!


* Next up: Another App!

Next time, we'll make a &quot;beginners&quot; attempt at a database-backed App,
and see what we can do to make it better.

* Notes:

[1] Automated test cases make programming *much* more fun, but
    that's a topic for another day. For more on this idea, see:
