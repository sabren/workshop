Python is a cross-platform, object-oriented, semi-compiled 
programming language. It's very clean and easy to read and write, partially because it uses indentation as syntax.

Here's a simple python program, that defines a class, instantiates 
it, and calls a method:

{{{
class Hello:
    def sayhi(self):
        print "hello!"

Hello().sayhi()
}}}

I once wrote a FiveMinutePythonIntroduction...
