<h1>lesson 03: strongbox</h1>

<h2>In Search of a Data Model</h2>

<p>Usually, when we're building a web app, we want to deal
with more than one type of data object, and store the data
in some sort of database.</p>

<p>If that's the case, then one of our first goals is to
figure out what sort of data objects we're going to work
with, and how they relate.</p>

<p>A good rule of thumb is that if you have a written
description of the system you want to build, and you
underline all the nouns, you'll wind up with a list of the
data objects you'll need.</p>

<p>For example, in the description of the control panel, I
mentioned nouns like:</p>

<ul>
<li>machine (as in the web servers)</li>
<li>user</li>
<li>domain</li>
<li>email address</li>
<li>website </li>
<li>account balance</li>
<li>billing history</li>
</ul>
 
<p>
All of these can be stored as a single record in a database,
so this is a good starting point. <a href="#foot_1">[1]</a>
</p>


<h2>Fleshing it Out</h2>

<p>On the other hand, this is just a skeleton of a data
model.  Once we know what the objects are, we want to know
what sort of data they'll contain, and how they relate to
each other.</p>

<p>Let's look at email addresses as an example.</p>

<p>When a user adds a domain to her account, I configure the
server to accept all mail for that domain. Usually, all the
mail goes directly to her inbox. But sometimes, she wants
her mail to go to her existing email address, or to forward
certain <code>usernames@herdomain</code> to 
outside addresses.</p>

<p>The way I'd handle these fields is to make the catch-all
address a property of the domain, and each forwarding
address is an object of its own. <a href="#foot_2">[2]</a></p>

<p>Here is how I might define the &quot;Domain&quot; and
&quot;Forward&quot; data objects in python:</p>

<pre>
from strongbox import Strongbox, attr

class Domain(Strongbox):
    ID = attr(long)
    userID = attr(long)
    domain = attr(str)
    mailto = attr(str)

class Forward(Strongbox):
    ID = attr(long)
    domainID = attr(long)
    virtuser = attr(str)
    mailto = attr(str)
</pre>


<h2>What's a Strongbox?</h2>

<p>Python doesn't usually make it this easy to declare what
attributes a class has. Normally, you can add just about
anything to an object, and python doesn't care.</p>

<p>With a data model, it's nice to be able to restrict which
attributes are available, and what can go in them. </p>

<p>This is especially important when storing objects in a
relational database, because the database only has certain
columns. If we try to put data into an attribute without a
corresponding column, we'll lose data, so we want to make
sure trying would throw an error.</p>

<p>The Strongbox module lets us limit an object's attributes in
this way. For example, f you put the above code in an *.app
file at cornerhost, and then add the line:</p>

<pre>
  d = Domain(name=&quot;webappworkshop.com&quot;)
</pre>

<p>... You'll get an error.</p>

<p>
Why? Because &quot;name&quot; is not a valid attribute of
the &quot;Domain&quot; class. Change it to
&quot;domain&quot; and it'll work fine.
</p>

<p>
Besides defining simple attributes like these, Strongbox
lets you validate attributes according to more advanced
python features, such as lambdas, regular expressions, and
accessor methods. <a href="#foot_3">[3]</a></p>

<p>More importantly, though, defining your data objects in a
standard form like this makes it easy to build generic tools
to deal with them. For example, if you choose to store these
objects in a MySQL database, you can write an class that
will take a Strongbox object and a table name, and
automatically generate the SQL for creating, retreiving,
updating, and deleting the appropriate rows in the
database. In fact, I've already done that, and I'll talk
about that in an upcoming lesson.</p>


<p>In the next lesson, though, we'll take a break from the
data objects, and actually build a simple web app!</p>

Notes:

<p>
<a name="foot_1">[1]</a> All the nouns work as objects
    except &quot;billing history&quot; (which would most
    likely be a set of &quot;transaction&quot; or
    &quot;event&quot; objects)
</p>
    
<p>We wouldn't store a &quot;website&quot; in the control
    panel database, either, but we might store the
    information needed to configure the webserver to serve
    that site.</p>


<p><a name="foot_2">[2]</a> I treat my data model as a
    relational database, which I can enhance by adding
    behaviors. Therefore, I follow the same rules of
    normalization (eliminating redunandcy) that one normally
    follows when designing a database.  For a quick overview
    of these rules, see:
