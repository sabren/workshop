= Storage Module Ideas =

The combination of strongbox, storage, and arlo is great.  I can define a class, set a database connection, and be updating a database in minutes.  No SQL required.  This is very similar to the [http://sqlobject.org SQLObject] module (although its data model is tightly coupled with the database).

One big strength in databases is their powerful querying ability.  In contrast, a limitation of most ORMs is their simple querying ability.

== XML Serializer ==

I would like to experiment with an XML Serializer for strongbox classes.  Instead of using a dbmap to map it to arlo, pass an xmlmap to an XML Serializer object.  

This way, you could map the Rantalope Story objects to an Atom XML format and pass it back and forth using the Atom API.

Just a thought I'd like to explore sometime...
