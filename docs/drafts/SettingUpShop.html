Here is how I set up a new development environment. This is
already set up on all cornerhost servers, but you might want
to run the latest version, or you might need your own
weblib.cgi because you're using suEXEC.

<hr/>
<pre>


First, I check out the modules. I run this under suEXEC, so I put the libraries in my home directory... If you're using apache and don't want to use suEXEC, you can choose to put it under ~/web/whatever instead (so apache doesn't need rights to your home directory)

{{{
% mkdir lib
% cd lib
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev login
(no password)
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co arlo
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co handy
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co pytypes
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co ransacker
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co sixthday
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co storage
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co strongbox
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co weblib
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co zebra
% cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@sixthdev.versionhost.com:/cvs/sixthdev co sdunit
}}}

For apache, I then create a copy of weblib/adapters/weblib.cgi and
put it somewhere under my website's document root. Then I add this
to my .htaccess file:

{{{
Action webapp /path/to/weblib.cgi # relative to site's docroot
AddHandler webapp .app            # preconfigured at cornerhost 
}}}

Of course, weblib.cgi is a normal cgi script and needs the proper permissions:

{{{
% chmod 755 weblib.cgi
}}}

I also need to '''edit weblib.cgi''' and change the sys.path line to
include the full path to the "lib" directory I created, eg:

{{{
# in weblib.cgi:
sys.path = ["/home/michal/lib"] + sys.path # or wherever you put "lib"
}}}

That's all you need to get things working, but since I work on the modules themselves, I add one other step.

The ["sdunit"] package contains the sixthday unit-testing tools, for testing all modules. Since I work from the shell, I create a file called ~/bin/sdunit with the following command:

{{{
# contents of ~/bin/sdunit
python ~/lib/sdunit/sdunit.py $1 $2 $3
}}}

And then run:

{{{
% chmod 700 ~/bin/sdunit
}}}

You can do this same thing from your home computer. For example, on windows I use the following sdunit.bat file:

{{{
@echo off
c:\python22\python w:/lib/sdunit/sdunit.py %1 %2 %3
}}}

You can test sdunit by doing this:

{{{
% cd ~/lib/weblib # or wherever you put "lib"
% sdunit
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+
              Engine: ...........
     OutputDecorator: ...
         RequestData: .
             Request: ......s
            Response: .....
                Sess: .......
         SqlSessPool: s
             Twisted:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+
}}}

The dots indicate passing tests. "s" indicates a skipped (disabled)
test. If any errors show up, you'll see them.

I usually run sdunit every time I enter a new line of code -- or at
the very least, once a minute or so. See TestDrivenDevelopment for
more on this.

=== fixing path errrors ===

If you get an error message like:

{{{
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=+
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/michal/lib/sdunit/sdunit.py", line 80, in ?
    if file.endswith("Test.py")]
  File "/home/michal/lib/sdunit/sdunit.py", line 56, in runTest
    exec "from spec.%sTest import %sTest; TC=%sTest" \
  File "<string>", line 1, in ?
'''ImportError: No module named spec.EngineTest'''
}}}

This means that python can't find the "spec" directory... You need to put "." on the path:

{{{
% export PYTHONPATH=~/lib:.
}}}

I usually put that "export" command in my ~/.bash_profile file so it runs every time I log in:

{{{
# in ~/.bash_profile for unix:
export PYTHONPATH=~/lib:.
}}}

On windows, I have this in my autoexec.bat:

{{{
REM autoexec.bat for win32
SET PYTHONPATH=w:\lib;.
}}}
