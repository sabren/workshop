Buggernaut is the sixthday issue tracking system.

Requirements (very rough):

  * hierarchical trees of goals 
  * time estimates and actual times for each goal
  * goals are color coded by priority
  * assign tasks to multiple people
  * assign goals to arbitrary categories

Much of this is already done in straight CGI...
